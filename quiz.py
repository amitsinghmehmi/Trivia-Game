# Description: This program is simillar to a Who Wants to Be a Millionare game. However, in this program/game, you are given two lives and two lifelines.
# Answering questions right will win you money depending on how far you advance in the levels. Typing in lifeline as the answer will give you a hint if
# you are stuck, this can be used twice in a question if you are really stuck. If you run out of lives, you lose all the money you gained and are prompted
# to enter if you want to play again, as well as showing how many question you got right
